# NearlyNewton

What are the rules of NearlyNewton?

* Don't be a mess!
* Support reasonable number types!
* Support all arrays!
* In-place and out-of-place for all situations!
* Fail softly to facilitate diagnosis!
* Be generic (linsolves, linear operators, ...)
* Be fast!

# Examples

## Scalar optimization (w/ different number types)

## Multivariate optimization (w/ different number and array types)

## Custom solve
